/**T
 * Each {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.Command} has multiple paths to it - also known as routes.
 * Each of the paths in the command is a different usage for it. For example, a command might have the
 * following paths:
 * !ban [user: {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.arguments.types.MemberArgument}] [reason: {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.arguments.types.StringArgument}]
 * !ban [user: {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.arguments.types.MemberArgument}] [time: {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.arguments.types.StringArgument}] [timeunit] [reason: {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.arguments.types.StringArgument}]
 * Each of the paths in the command will have a method mapped to it - the mapped method must be annotated
 * with {@link CommandPath} with the path name that is the same as specified in {@link io.github.dretacbe.jdacommands.Command#addPath(String, List)}.
 * The method will have all of its arguments passed in directly plus the member that ran the command.
 * e.g. for the first path specified above,
 * {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Message} (the message), {@link net.dv8tion.jda.api.entities.Member} (the user) and {@link String} (the reason) will be
 * passed into the method.
 * <p>
 * If {@link #literals()} is true, then the literals as strings will be passed in in their respective order as well.
